            <p class="description">It's almost that time of year again, so I thought I'd make some vaguely seasonal cookies (the cranberries are what make them Christmas-y). I made a double batch of approx. 55 and they all came out pretty much perfect.</p>

            <p class="description">I made these for a co-worker's Birthday. They were a litte dry considering they had yoghurt in them (which usually makes for a moister bake). Next time I'd try them full size.</p>
